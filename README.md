To use the Scrapy IMDb scraper, pull this repository and go to the `Scrapy/imdb_scraper` directory in your terminal.
Run this command `scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o scrapy_movies.csv` and you will find `scrapy_movies.csv` in the `Scrapy/imdb_scraper` directory.

P.S.: if you don't have Scrapy installed, use: `pip install Scrapy` in your terminal.
